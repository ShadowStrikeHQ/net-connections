# net-connections

## Project Description

net-connections is a cybersecurity tool that helps track and log network connections. It provides basic network operations, such as connecting to a remote host, sending and receiving data, and closing the connection. net-connections is ideal for security professionals who need to monitor network activity and identify potential threats.

## Installation

To install net-connections, run the following command:

```
pip install net-connections
```

## Usage Examples

To use net-connections, open a terminal window and type the following command:

```
net-connections [-h] [-v] [-f FILENAME] [-t TIMEOUT] [-p PROTOCOL] HOST PORT
```

where:

* **-h** displays the help message
* **-v** enables verbose output
* **-f FILENAME** specifies the file to which the connection log will be written
* **-t TIMEOUT** specifies the timeout in seconds for the connection attempt
* **-p PROTOCOL** specifies the protocol to use for the connection (default: TCP)

* **PORT** is the port number of the remote host

For example, to connect to a remote host on port 80 using the TCP protocol and log the connection to a file called "connection.log", you would type the following command:
